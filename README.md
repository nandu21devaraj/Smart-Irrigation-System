🌱 Smart Irrigation System with Soil Moisture Sensor and Weather Awareness

This project automates irrigation using a soil moisture sensor and weather API. The system stores data in a local SQLite database and visualizes moisture trends with graphs.

 📈 How it Works

1. The soil moisture sensor reads the current moisture level.
2. The data is logged into a SQLite database using `moisture_log.py`.
3. The OpenWeather API checks for rain prediction.
4. If soil is dry and no rain is expected, irrigation is activated.
5. Historical moisture levels are shown through graphs.

📌 Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Connect the sensor and motor driver to Raspberry Pi.
3. Run the scripts:
   ```bash
   python3 SOIL_mois.py
   python3 moisture_log.py
View data logs and graphs for trends.
